# Data - extended Laravel Model

# EXPERIMENTAL CODE - Use at your own risk

This is extended functionality for Laravel Models. It sets up basic functionality I use.

- Extended Laravel Model: \Data\BaseModel
- Standard Exceptions: currently only 1 for ModelNotFoundException
- Traits and classes for using Laravel Migrations
